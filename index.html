				Welcome to ClubFinder!
			<p>
				This website is meant to help you find which club on the MSJ campus is right for you.
        You will be asked a few questions about what interests you have, and we will then recommend you to clubs at MSJ.
        You will be shown a profile for each club, that will include a rating out of 5 stars and reviews from students and staff based on their experiences with the club.
        Sign up now to keep up with the clubs at your school!
